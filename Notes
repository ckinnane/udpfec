 1 Incoming UDP socket, encapsulate into buffer, decapsulate to forward address.
 2 Shared memory buffer.
 3 Timed buffer release.
 4 Threaded release, continous receiving and burst send operation.
 5 Refactor to threaded entrance and exit using shared memory.
 6 Sempaphores or signals to keep sync, reverse path.
 7 Include FEC into encasulate, decapsulate.
 8 Stats on packet loss to set FEC ratios dynamically.

1. Incoming UDP socket, encapsulate into buffer, decapsulate to forward address.
	needs a linked list data structure to place incoming packets for a set
	period before releasing
	* serialised linked lists in C,
	* timout callback in C down to milliseconds is ok - nanoseconds better.
	* at timeout, release packets in one shot
2.
